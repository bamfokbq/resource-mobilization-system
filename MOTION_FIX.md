# Fix: Element Type Invalid Error Resolution

## Problem
The dashboard was throwing an error: "Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports."

The error was specifically occurring in the `UserStatsCard` component.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the `motion` import from `'motion/react'` not being resolved correctly, causing `motion.div` and other motion components to be undefined.

## Solution
Replaced the motion-based animations with CSS-based transitions and transforms to eliminate the dependency issue.

### Changes Made

1. **UserStatsCard.tsx**:
   - Removed `import { motion } from 'motion/react';`
   - Replaced `motion.div` with regular `div`
   - Replaced `motion.p` with regular `p`
   - Added CSS-based hover effects: `hover:scale-105`
   - Kept all styling and functionality intact

2. **ActiveSurveyCard.tsx**:
   - Removed `import { motion } from 'motion/react';`
   - Replaced `motion.div` elements with regular `div`
   - Added CSS transforms: `transform hover:scale-105 hover:-translate-y-1`
   - Added CSS transition for progress bar: `transition-all duration-1000 ease-out`
   - Maintained all visual effects using pure CSS

### Benefits
- ✅ Eliminates import/export errors
- ✅ Removes dependency on potentially problematic motion library
- ✅ Maintains visual appeal with CSS animations
- ✅ Better performance with CSS transforms vs JS animations
- ✅ More reliable across different environments

### CSS Animations Used
- `transform hover:scale-105` - Hover scaling effect
- `hover:-translate-y-1` - Hover lift effect  
- `transition-all duration-300` - Smooth transitions
- `hover:shadow-xl` - Enhanced shadow on hover
- `transition-all duration-1000 ease-out` - Progress bar animation

## Result
The dashboard now loads without errors and maintains all the modern, interactive visual effects using reliable CSS-based animations instead of the problematic motion library imports.

All components export correctly and the dashboard renders successfully with full functionality.
